# SDC260 Steven McGraw Course Project

This project was created to learn and explore new talents acquired during my time in this course. Over the last 5 weeks I have learned about creating a github workspace, CSS3 styling, structural and visual enhancements, responsive design, and deployment/local hosting. Please look around and feel free to critique!
